To initiate configs on a computer run:

    . setup.sh {guest|host}

### NOTE:
things have gotten a little more complicated with my setup. everything is now modularized into .bashrc_<tool> files. the current oversight is that you will not nessecarily know which tools are installed - there needs to be a check for the standard tools and a script which gives the option of installing them.

For the time being, I'll just write a list:
+ nvm
+ emacs prelude
+ pyenv
+ fasd
+ ... and more!
