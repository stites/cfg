Bash is a Message Style for Adium.

h2. How do I get this to work

You go to your Adium Message Style directory.

cd ~/Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Message Styles

And then you clone this repository.

git clone git://github.com/jao/Bash.AdiumMessageStyle.git

After that go to your Adium's Message Style Preferences window, and choose the one named Bash, and pick your favorite variant.

Visit the "Xtra's page":http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=3665 and click *install* if you don't want to do all this.
